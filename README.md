# React + Styled Component + tailwindcss 2 Starter boilerplate

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
This project was bootstrapped after reading this article from Freecodecamp [How to Style Your React Apps](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-style-your-react-apps-with-less-code-using-tailwind-css-and-styled-components/#:~:text=Tailwind%20is%20a%20utility%2Dfirst,into%20CSS%2Din%2DJS.).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn build:css`

### `yarn watch:css`

These two scripts build:css and watch:css will respectively build the CSS and watch for changes and rebuild it if needed. And as I said earlier, the output file will be located in the assets folder.

### `yarn start`

start the development

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

### `yarn eject`

You don't really need to touch this unless you know what you are doing!
